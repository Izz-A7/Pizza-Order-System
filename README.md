# Pizza-Order-System
This project is a Python script that simulates a pizza ordering system. The user can order pizzas of different sizes and toppings. The script generates a receipt for the order, including the total cost of the order with taxes.

## Skills Learned
- Python syntax and programming concepts
- Using loops and conditional statements
- Taking user input and validating it
- Organizing code into functions
- Working with lists and tuples in Python
- Basic file import and export in Python
- Basic mathematical computations in Python

## Usage
To use this script, simply run the order.py file in your Python environment. Follow the prompts to place your pizza order. The script will generate a receipt for your order.

## Constants
The script includes several constants at the beginning of the file. These constants define the cost of pizzas and toppings, the tax percentage, and the number of free toppings.

## Functions
The script includes a single function, generateReceipt, that takes in a list of orders and generates a receipt based on those orders.

## Limitations
This script is a basic simulation of a pizza ordering system and does not include many of the features of a real pizza ordering system. Additionally, the script does not have any error handling in place and may crash if the user inputs invalid data.

## Possible Improvements
- Adding error handling to prevent crashes from invalid data
- Allowing users to remove toppings from their orders
- Adding more customization options, such as sauce choices and crust options
- Creating a more robust interface for the user to interact with

## Conclusion
This project taught me the basics of Python programming and helped me gain experience working with loops, conditionals, and user input. I also learned about organizing code into functions and using constants to make the code more readable and maintainable.
